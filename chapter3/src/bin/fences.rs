// In addition to operations on atomic variables, there is one more thing that
// we can apply a memory ordering to: atomic fences.



// An atomic fence allows you to separate the memory
// ordering from the atomic operation. 
// This can be useful if you want to apply a memory ordering 
// to multiple operations, or if you only want to apply it conditionally.
